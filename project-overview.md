# Project Overview

Project Name: Smart Documentation Generator

Description: A GenStack project that *simulates* the automated generation of project documentation from a GitHub repository and associated documents (like PDFs). The user provides a GitHub URL and document, and the application *mocks* the process of analyzing both to generate interactive and helpful documentation within a Next.js website.

Features:

*   Repo URL Input: User can enter a GitHub repository URL (e.g., `cloudflare/next-on-pages`).
*   Document Upload: User can upload related documents (e.g., a project roadmap PDF).
*   AI-Powered Analysis (Mocked): An "AI bot" *simulates* analyzing the repo and documents to understand the project.
*   Documentation Generation (Mocked): The application *simulates* generating documentation pages, including:
    *   Project overview and key concepts.
    *   File structure and important modules.
    *   Dependency analysis.
    *   Contribution guidelines.
*   Interactive UI: Documentation is presented in a clean, navigable Next.js website with a search function and interactive elements.

Target Audience: Developers, project managers, and anyone who wants to quickly generate documentation.

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
